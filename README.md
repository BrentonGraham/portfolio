# Brenton Graham - Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction  
My name is Brenton Graham and I am currently a Master's (MS) student studying Biostatistics at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus. In this repository I organize relevant work from research projects, personal projects, and course-related projects that employ machine learning and statistical inference techniques. My work primarily focuses on biological data problems (e.g. multi-omics data, clinical data, etc), although I am interested in applying my skillset to non-biological problems. Programming languages include Python, R, and SAS.  

## Projects  
### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
#### Research  
This section includes work from my research position at CU Anschutz. My work here has focused on multi-omics data (primarily 16S rRNA microbiome data) in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Not all work here is published. Most work was done for exploration. Data are protected and are therefore not available for public viewing.  

#### Biomedical Machine Learning  
This section includes work from a Biomedical Machine Learning course I took at CU Anschutz. Each assignment came with a provided data set (some clean, some not) and general assignment goals. No solutions were provided, however, and assignments were somewhat open-ended, so all code and work is original.  

| Topic | Description | ML Techniques | Code / Notebook |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Linear Regression | Predicting treatment response (systolic blood pressure) from baseline risk factors using simple OLS regression and polynomial regression techniques. | OLS Regression, Polynomial Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/LinearRegression.ipynb) |
| Real World Regression | Determining useful predictors of cancer patient survival time using cell measurements and demographic information. Polynomial regression used for prediction. Additional techniques explored in this report include missing data, multicollinearity, and outlier handling. | Polynomial Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/2.%20Real%20World%20Regression/RealWorldRegression.ipynb) |
| Logistic Regression & Cross-Validation | Evaluating the feasibility of distinguishing pathologic cardiac hypertrophy (from physiological cardiac hypertrophy) using logistic regression. Additionally exploring the effect of varying the size of k in k-fold cross-validation. | Logistic Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/3.%20Logistic%20Regression%20%26%20Cross-Validation/LogisticRegression%26CrossValidation.ipynb) |
| Classification | Predicting the risk of stroke using three types of binary classifiers (RF, SVM, LR). Report includes hyperparameter tuning, classifier evaluation, and model selection in the context of an imbalanced class problem. | Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), & Logistic Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/tree/main/4.%20Classification%20%26%20Model%20Selection) |

Additionally using PCA for dimensionality reduction. | K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, PCA, LDA | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/tree/main/5.%20Clustering) |
| Deep Learning: MLP | Building simple neural networks (single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons) to classify cancer from gene expression data. Additionally testing the performance of a linear classifier (i.e. logistic regression model) to evaluate similarities with the single-layer perceptron build. | Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/6.%20Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/IntroDeepLearning.ipynb), [MLP.py](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/6.%20Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/NN_MultiLayer.py) |
