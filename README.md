| Topic | Description | ML Techniques | Code / Notebook |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Linear Regression | Predicting treatment response (systolic blood pressure) from baseline risk factors using simple OLS regression and polynomial regression techniques. | OLS Regression, Polynomial Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/LinearRegression.ipynb) |
| Real World Regression | Determining useful predictors of cancer patient survival time using cell measurements and demographic information. Polynomial regression used for prediction. Additional techniques explored in this report include missing data, multicollinearity, and outlier handling. | Polynomial Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/2.%20Real%20World%20Regression/RealWorldRegression.ipynb) |
| Logistic Regression & Cross-Validation | Evaluating the feasibility of distinguishing pathologic cardiac hypertrophy (from physiological cardiac hypertrophy) using logistic regression. Additionally exploring the effect of varying the size of k in k-fold cross-validation. | Logistic Regression | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/3.%20Logistic%20Regression%20%26%20Cross-Validation/LogisticRegression%26CrossValidation.ipynb) |
| Classification |  | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM) |  |
| Clustering |  |  | K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS |  |
| Deep Learning: MLP |  | Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network |  |
| Deep Learning: CNN |  | Convolutional Neural Network |  |
