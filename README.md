| Topic | Description | Code / Notebook |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Linear Regression | Predicting treatment response (systolic blood pressure) using linear and polynomial regression techniques | [Notebook](https://github.com/BrentonGraham/biomedical-ml-anschutz/blob/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression/LinearRegression.ipynb) |
| Real World Regression | Determining useful predictors of cancer patient survival time using cell measurements and demographic information. Polynomial regression used for prediction. Additional techniques explored in this report include missing data, multicollinearity, and outlier handling. |
